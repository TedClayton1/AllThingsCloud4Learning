Cloud Build uses build triggers to enable CI/CD automation.

* You can configure triggers to listen for incoming events, such as when a new commit is pushed to a repository or when a pull request is initiated, push new tag, Manual invocation, pub/sub message, webhook event and then automatically execute a build when new events come in. 
* You can configure triggers to build code on any changes to your source repository or only on changes that match certain criteria.
* You can connect external repositories, such as repositories in GitHub or Bitbucket, to Cloud Build or use code in Cloud Source Repositories for your builds.
