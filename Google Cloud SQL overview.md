Cloud SQL is a fully managed relational database service for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server. This frees you from database administration tasks so that you have more time to manage your data



How does Google Cloud SQL work?

**Each Cloud SQL instance is powered by a virtual machine (VM) running on a host Google Cloud server**. Each VM operates the database program, such as MySQL Server, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server, and service agents that provide supporting services, such as logging and monitoring.
