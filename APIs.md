API stands forÂ **Application Programming Interface**. In the context of APIs, the word Application refers to any software with a distinct function. Interface can be thought of as a contract of service between two applications. This contract defines how the two communicate with each other using requests and responses.

An API sets the rules of engagement between the app requesting for information and the app receiving from the sender said information. An [[API Call]] happens all the time between applications.
