"Planet scale" in cloud computing refers to ==the ability of a system to scale up and handle massive amounts of data and user traffic==, essentially allowing it to grow and function effectively even with a very large user base, similar to how a planet can accommodate a vast number of inhabitants; in the context of cloud services, "PlanetScale" is often specifically associated with the database platform of the same name, which is designed to achieve this level of scalability through features like horizontal sharding and distributed architecture.

Key points about "Planet scale":

- **Large-scale capacity:**
    
    It signifies the potential to handle a huge volume of data and requests without performance degradation. 
    
- **Horizontal scaling:**
    
    This is often achieved through techniques like sharding, where data is distributed across multiple servers to distribute the workload. 
    
- **High availability:**
    
    Systems operating at "planet scale" are usually designed to be highly resilient and fault-tolerant, ensuring continuous operation even if some components fail. 
    

How PlanetScale relates to this concept:

- **MySQL-compatible database:**
    
    PlanetScale is a managed database service built on top of MySQL, which allows developers to leverage familiar SQL syntax while still achieving large-scale operations. 
    
- **Vitess integration:**
    
    PlanetScale utilizes the open-source Vitess technology to enable horizontal sharding and seamlessly scale databases across multiple servers. 
    
- **Serverless architecture:**
    
    This feature allows users to pay only for the resources they actively use, further enhancing scalability.
