Endpoints are physical devices that connect to and exchange information with a computer network. Some examples of endpoints are mobile devices, desktop computers, virtual machines, embedded devices, and servers. Internet-of-Things devices—like cameras, lighting, refrigerators, security systems, smart speakers, and thermostats—are also endpoints. When a device connects to a network, the flow of information between, for instance, a laptop and a network, is much like a conversation between two people over the phone.
