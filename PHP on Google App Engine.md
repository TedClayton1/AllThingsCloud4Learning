App Engine offers you a choice between two PHP language environments. Both environments have the same code-centric developer workflow, scale quickly and efficiently to handle increasing demand, and enable you to use Googleâ€™s proven serving technology to build your web, mobile and IoT applications quickly and with minimal operational overhead. While the two environments have a lot in common, they differ in a few important ways.

## Choose your preferred environment

### Standard environment

- The PHP 5 runtime does not allow native code, filesystem access, or arbitrary network connections, and has proprietary APIs.
    
- Optimized to scale nearly instantaneously to handle huge traffic spikes.
    
- [Free tier](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/pricing).
    
- Ubuntu OS

### Flexible environment

- Open source runtimes capable of running any framework, library, or binary.
    
- Greater CPU and memory instance types.
    
- Can access resources in the same Compute Engine network.
    
- No free tier. Application always has a minimum number of running instances. Most cost-effective for applications that serve traffic continuously.
    
- Ubuntu OS
