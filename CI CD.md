CI and CD stand forÂ **continuous integration and continuous delivery/continuous deployment**. In very simple terms, CI is a modern software development practice in which incremental code changes are made frequently and reliably.

Continuous integration is a practice where developers frequently submit code to a common repository. The code is reviewed and tested. After validation, automatic builds are triggered. Continuous delivery allows for the automation of the release process so that the software can be deployed to the target environment at any point in time. In continuous deployment, any changes that are made by a developer that pass all the tests are automatically deployed to the production environment.
