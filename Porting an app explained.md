Porting an app is ==the process of adjusting software to run in a different environment than it was originally designed for==. This could involve moving an app from one operating system to another or from one hardware platform to another.  

Porting an app can make it more accessible and usable to a wider audience. It can also help an app's longevity and success by allowing it to reach more systems and platforms.  

Here are some things to consider when porting an app:  

- Macros
    
    In C and C++, macros are a common porting tool. One technique is to use a macro for each platform to turn code lines on and off. Another technique is to define macros for each feature and use them to enable and disable code.  
    
- Ports
    
    A port is a qualifier that system software uses to differentiate between applications that use the same network interface. It helps get data to the correct application.
