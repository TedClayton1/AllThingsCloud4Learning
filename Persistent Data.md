Persistent data is ==data that is stored on a non-volatile storage medium and does not disappear when a computer loses power==. This type of storage is also known as persistent storage or local storage. Local data persistence can be used to save data on a user's device when an app crashes or the device loses internet connection. It can also ensure that edits to data are preserved if an application closes before the user can save changes to the server. 

Here are some examples of how local data persistence can be used: 

- JavaScript
    
    Local storage can be used to maintain a shopping cart's contents so users can resume their shopping experience.
