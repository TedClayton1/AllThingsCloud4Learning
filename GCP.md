## What is GCP?

GCP is a public cloud vendor — like competitors [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://www.pluralsight.com/resources/blog/cloud/what-is-amazon-web-services-aws) and [Microsoft Azure](https://www.pluralsight.com/resources/blog/cloud/what-is-microsoft-azure). With GCP and other cloud vendors, customers are able to access computer resources housed in Google’s data centers around the world for free or on a pay-per-use basis.

GCP offers a suite of computing services to do everything from [GCP cost management](https://acloudguru.com/course/cost-control-on-gcp) to data management to delivering web and video over the web to AI and machine learning tools.
