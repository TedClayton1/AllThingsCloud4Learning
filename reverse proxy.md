A reverse proxy is ==a server, app, or cloud service that acts as an intermediary between a client and one or more web servers==. When a client sends a request to a website's origin server, the reverse proxy intercepts the request at the network edge and forwards it to the web server. The reverse proxy then returns the server's response to the client, making it appear as if the proxy server processed the request.
