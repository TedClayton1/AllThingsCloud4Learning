A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a character sequence that identifies a logical (abstract) or physical resource -- usually, but not always, connected to the internet. A URI distinguishes one resource from another.

URIs enable [internet](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/Internet) protocols to facilitate interactions between and among these resources. The strings of characters incorporated in a URI serve as identifiers, such as a scheme name and a file path.

In the URI, the file path may be empty.
