An IDE, or Integrated Development Environment, is ==a software application that combines many development tools into one place to help programmers write code more efficiently==.  

Some features of an IDE include:  
- Text editor: Allows users to edit text      
- Project editor: Allows users to edit projects      
- Tool bar: Provides tools to users      
- Output viewer: Displays the output of the code  
    

Without an IDE, developers would need to use separate tools for each development function, such as a text editor and a compiler.  

There are many different types of IDEs, including:  

- Multi-language IDEs: Support multiple programming languages, such as Eclipse, Aptana, Komodo, NetBeans, and Geany  
    
- Cloud IDEs: Web-based platforms that allow remote access to projects and enable real-time collaboration  
    
- Mobile IDEs: Work with code for iOS or Android devices  
    
- Cross-platform mobile IDEs: Can create code for multiple mobile platforms  
    

Some examples of IDEs include NetBeans, Eclipse, IntelliJ, and Visual Studio.
