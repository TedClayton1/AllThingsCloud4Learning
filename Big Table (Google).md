Bigtable is a sparsely populated table that can scale to billions of rows and thousands of columns, enabling you to store terabytes or even petabytes of data. A single value in each row is indexed; this value is known as the row key. Bigtable is ideal for storing large amounts of single-keyed data with low latency.

As of January 2022, Google Cloud Bigtable was able to handle ==more than 5 billion requests per second==. At peak, Bigtable has been known to process over 6 billion requests per second. Bigtable's performance is predictable and linearly scalable, allowing users to increase or decrease the number of cluster nodes to scale their operations without downtime. Bigtable can also automatically scale up or down to meet changing workload demands. 

Bigtable's approximate throughput depends on the type of storage used by the cluster. For example, an SSD cluster can provide up to 17,000 rows per second for reads, 14,000 rows per second for writes, and 220 MB/s for scans. An HDD cluster can provide up to 500 rows per second for reads, 10,000 rows per second for writes, and 180 MB/s for scans. These estimates assume that each row contains 1 KB of data.
