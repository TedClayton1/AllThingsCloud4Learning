Memcached is ==a free, open-source software system that helps websites store and retrieve data quickly, without reloading pages==. It's often used to speed up dynamic websites by caching data in RAM instead of reading from a database or API. 

Here are some things to know about Memcached: 

- How it works
    
    Memcached is a key-value store that distributes data across multiple servers. When a request is made for data that isn't in the cache, it's forwarded to other servers in the cluster. 
    
- What it's used for
    
    Memcached is used in web applications, mobile apps, gaming, ad-tech, and e-commerce. 
    
- How it's designed
    
    Memcached's design promotes quick deployment and ease of development. It also helps solve problems that large data caches face. 
    
- How it's licensed
    
    Memcached is licensed under the Revised BSD license. 
    
- Where it runs
    
    Memcached runs on Unix-like operating systems (Linux and macOS) and on Microsoft Windows.
  

- Memcached is **a popular distributed in-memory key-value store used for building such applications**. Some of the common Memcached use cases include caching of reference data, database query caching, and, in some cases, use as a session store.
