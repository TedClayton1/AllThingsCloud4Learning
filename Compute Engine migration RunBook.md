The framework illustrated in the preceding diagram has four phases:  
ג€¢ Assess. In this phase, you assess your source environment, assess the workloads that you want to migrate to Google Cloud, and assess which VMs support each workload.  
ג€¢ Plan. In this phase, you create the basic infrastructure for Migrate for Compute Engine, such as provisioning the resource hierarchy and setting up network access.  
ג€¢ Deploy. In this phase, you migrate the VMs from the source environment to Compute Engine.  
ג€¢ Optimize. In this phase, you begin to take advantage of the cloud technologies and capabilities.
