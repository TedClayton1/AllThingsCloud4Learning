Tunnel mode in a virtual private network (VPN) is ==a method for sending data over the internet while encrypting both the data and the original IP address information==. It works by wrapping packets of data inside other packets, which are then sent through a VPN server. This process creates a secure tunnel that hides the user's IP address and virtual location, and ensures that their traffic is unreadable to third parties
