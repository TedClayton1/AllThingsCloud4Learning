Total cost of ownership (TCO) in cloud computing is ==the total cost of using cloud technology over its lifetime==. It includes all costs associated with deploying, operating, maintaining, and upgrading cloud services. TCO is a key factor in budget planning and is essential for businesses to make informed decisions about cloud investments. 

TCO includes a variety of costs, such as:

- **Infrastructure costs**: The cost of virtual machines, storage, and network resources 
- **Support costs**: The cost of ongoing maintenance, updates, and customer support 
- **Software licensing**: The cost of software services, such as databases or management tools 

- **Data storage**: The cost of storing and retrieving data in the cloud 

- **Network bandwidth**: The cost of data transfer between cloud and local sites 

- **Backup and disaster recovery**: The cost of data backup fees and disaster recovery expenses 

- **Personnel expenses**: The cost of salaries for IT staff managing your cloud system 

- **Exit costs**: The cost of transitioning away from a cloud provider or platform 

TCO differs from traditional cost accounting because it considers the entire lifecycle of an asset and the broader implications of its use. 

Some cloud providers, like Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure, offer TCO calculators to help businesses evaluate the true financial impact of cloud adoption.
