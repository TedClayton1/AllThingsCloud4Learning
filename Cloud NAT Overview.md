Cloud NAT ([network address translation](https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation)) lets certain resources in Google Cloud create outbound connections to the internet or to other Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) networks, on-premises networks, or any other cloud provider networks. Cloud NAT supports address translation for established inbound response packets only. It does not allow unsolicited inbound connections.
