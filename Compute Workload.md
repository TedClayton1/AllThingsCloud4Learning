A compute workload in cloud computing is ==a service, application, or capability that uses cloud resources==. Workloads can be simple tasks or complex operations, and they can include virtual machines, databases, microservices, and more. 

Here are some things to know about compute workloads: 

- Types of workloads
    
    There are different types of workloads, including periodic and unpredictable workloads. Periodic workloads have specific times when they are used, such as an electricity bill payment app. Unpredictable workloads include social networks, online multiplayer games, and video streaming apps. 
    
- Benefits of cloud workloads
    
    Cloud workloads can provide more flexibility and agility than on-site workloads. For example, if on-site servers reach their limit, workloads can be shared or transferred to the cloud. 
    
- Managing workloads
    
    Managing workloads is important for IT resource optimization. It can affect system performance, cost, stability, and the success of business operations.
