A cloud storage API, or application programming interface (API), ==allows users to access, add, update, and delete data from cloud storage systems==. It acts as a bridge between a local application and cloud storage, allowing the application to send data to the cloud and interact with the stored data. To the application, the cloud storage system is like another device, such as disk-based storage. 

Cloud APIs are a type of API, which is an interface that allows data to be transferred between software programs. Developers can use APIs to share data and functionality across applications without having to rewrite code or rebuild functions. 

Cloud APIs can be configured for many purposes, but some common uses include: 

- Web apps and services: Allow web apps to request services and activities from a cloud storage server 
    
- Storing large data objects: Allow users to store and retrieve large, immutable data objects 
    
- Mounting buckets: Allow users to mount Cloud Storage buckets within a local machine's file system, allowing access using standard file system semantics
