Rootkits and bootkits are both types of malware that can be difficult to detect and remove. ==Rootkits are a collection of malicious software tools that give a threat actor remote control over a computer system.== ==Bootkits are an advanced form of rootkit that infect the master boot record (MBR) or the volume boot record (VBR) during computer startup==.  

Here are some more details about rootkits and bootkits:  

- Rootkits
    
    Rootkits can be installed in several ways, but they usually target a vulnerability in a computer's operating system or application. Rootkits can deactivate antivirus and antimalware software to prevent detection. They can also perform other functions, such as collecting memory dumps, intercepting user input and output, and updating the malware.  
    
- Bootkits
    
    Bootkits are designed to infect the MBR or VBR, which are records stored on the disk that start the operating system. Because bootkits are not stored in the Windows file system, ordinary operating system processes cannot identify them. Bootkits can remain on computers even after the operating system is reinstalled, and can only be fully removed by physically wiping the disk.  
    
- Types of rootkits
    
    There are several types of rootkits, including firmware rootkits, which infect the computer's hard drive and BIOS, and memory rootkits, which hide in the computer's RAM.
