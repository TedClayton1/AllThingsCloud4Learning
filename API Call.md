An API request, or API call, is ==a message sent to a server to request information or a service==. API requests are a way for programs to communicate with each other, and are often used by web applications.  

Here are some things to know about API requests:  

- How they work
    
    An API request is initiated by a client, who formats the request according to the API endpoint's protocol and schema. The API endpoint then receives the request, authenticates the client, and validates the schema.  
    
- What they can do
    
    API requests can be used to retrieve data, execute tasks, integrate with data sources, interact with software, and automate tasks.  
    
- What they include
    
    API requests typically include a URL, an HTTP method, and optional request parameters.  
    
- How to make them
    
    To make an API call, you need access to the API documentation, which provides information on the API's capabilities, request and response structure, and any authentication or authorization requirements. You may also need an API key or other credentials.  
    
- Common response codes
    
    Some common response codes for API requests include:  
    
    - 200 OK: The request was successful  
        
    - 201 Created: The resource has been created on the server  
        
    - 202 Accepted: The request has been received but is still being processed  
        
    - 204 No Content: The request has been successfully processed but no content will be returned
