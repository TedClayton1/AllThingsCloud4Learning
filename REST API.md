What is a REST API for dummies?

A REST API isÂ **based on the HTTP protocol and uses HTTP requests to POST (create), PUT (update), GET (read), and DELETE data**. These APIs are often exposed over a simple URL like https://example.com/api/users and applications can interact with this API by making HTTP requests to this URL/endpoint. Jan 29, 2023
