Versioning is ==a process that involves managing and creating multiple product releases that have the same general function but are improved, upgraded, or customized==. It can be used in many areas of cloud computing, including:

- Object versioning
    
    Preserves deleted objects as versioned, noncurrent objects that are still accessible in a bucket until they are explicitly removed. This feature can be used to track changes to objects and to recover specific versions of an object.
    
- Data versioning
    
    Involves maintaining and managing different versions of datasets over time. This process can help track and control changes to data, which can improve data governance, reproducibility, and traceability. It can also help speed up the development of data products, reduce errors, and show how data has changed over time.
    
- Software versioning
    
    Helps both users and software providers track the different versions that a company releases. Users can rely on software developers to keep them updated, and software vendors can use the insights they gather to help with their segmentation and monetization plans.
    
- Cloud APIs
    
    For example, Google Cloud requires that the stability level be appended to the version for the alpha and beta channels, but not for the stable channel.
