 **the percentage of times that a requested object is served from the cache**. If the cache hit ratio is 60%, it means that the requested object is served from the cache 60% of the time and must be retrieved from the origin 40% of the time.

The cache hit ratio (CHR) is ==a metric that measures how well a cache system serves data requests==. It's calculated by dividing the number of cache hits by the total number of requests, and then expressing the result as a percentage. 

A high CHR indicates that the cache is effective at serving most requests, which can improve a website's performance and speed. A low CHR can indicate inefficient caching and potential performance issues. 

Factors that can affect the CHR include: 

- Cache size: The amount of data that can be stored for quick access 
    
- Cache eviction policies: How the caching system decides which data to remove 
    

Improving the CHR can help website owners and developers: Reduce server load, Enhance page load times, Boost overall site performance, and Improve search engine optimization (SEO).
