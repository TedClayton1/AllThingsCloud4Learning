Preemptible instances use excess Compute Engine capacity, so their availability varies with usage. If your apps are fault-tolerant and can withstand possible instance preemptions, then preemptible instances can **reduce your Compute Engine costs significantly**.



*What is the difference between preemptible and standard VM?*

Preemptible instances are VM instances that can be created at a much lower price than a regular instance. **The only difference is that the compute engine can terminate these instances if those resources need to be reclaimed for other tasks**. Preemptible instances also have a 24-hour limit after which they are terminated.
