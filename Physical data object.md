A physical data object is ==a physical representation of data that can be used to read, look up, or write to data sources==. It can be based on a flat file or relational database table, and can be created in projects or folders. Physical data objects are reusable and can be used in any type of mapping, mapplet, or profile. For example, they can be added to a mapping or mapplet as a read, write, or lookup transformation. They can also be included in a virtual table mapping or operation mapping.

i.e 

Array and LinkedList
