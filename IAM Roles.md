IAM (Identity and Access Management) roles in cloud computing ==establish a baseline for managing access and permissions to resources==. They are similar to users, but instead of being associated with a specific person, a role can be assumed by anyone who needs it. Roles provide temporary security credentials to the person who assumes them, and do not have passwords or access keys. 

Different cloud computing platforms have different types of IAM roles, but some common roles include: 

- Administrator: Has full access to all resources 
    
- User: Has a standard role with defined permissions 
    
- Read-only: Can only view resources 
    
- Power user: Similar to an administrator, but with restrictions 
    
- Security auditor: Focuses on monitoring and auditing for security compliance
