Exponential backoff is a retry technique that ==increases the wait time between attempts exponentially after each failed request==. This technique is used to balance the need to retry operations with the need to reduce the load on a service or network. 

Here's how exponential backoff works: 

- Wait time increases: After each failed request, the wait time increases exponentially. For example, the wait time might double after each failed request. 
    
- Maximum backoff time: There is a maximum backoff time that the wait time cannot exceed. 
    
- Random "jitter": A random "jitter" is added to avoid many clients retrying simultaneously. 
    
- Capped exponential backoff: To avoid retrying for too long, implementations often use capped exponential backoff, which limits the maximum backoff time. 
    

Exponential backoff can be used when: 

- A service frequently throttles requests to prevent overload 
    
- Temporary network issues cause failures 
    
- The service being called is temporarily unavailable 
    

Exponential backoff can be combined with other design patterns, such as the Circuit Breaker pattern, to create a resilient solution to errors or failures.
