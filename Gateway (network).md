A network gateway is ==a device or software that allows data to flow between different networks by translating protocols from one network to another==. Gateways are a key component of connecting networks and the internet, and they can be found at the edge of a network. 

Here are some things to know about network gateways: 

- How they work
    
    Gateways act as an entry and exit point for a network, routing data through the correct paths. They can operate at any layer of the OSI model. 
    
- How they are used
    
    Gateways are used to connect networks that use different protocols or languages, such as a corporate network and the internet. 
    

- How they are implemented
    
    Gateways can be implemented as hardware or software. In larger organizations, servers are often used as gateways because they can handle large amounts of incoming connections. 
    

- How they are secured
    
    Gateways are often combined with security tools like firewalls to protect an organization's network. 
    

- How they are purchased
    
    Gateways can be purchased from retailers or rented from an internet service provider.
