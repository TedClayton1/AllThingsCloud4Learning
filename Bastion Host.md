A bastion host in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is ==a computer system that provides an external entry point to a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network==. This allows users to connect to virtual machines (VMs) that don't have external IP addresses, such as development environments or database instances. Bastion hosts can also be used to provide secure access to cloud infrastructure, internal systems, and remote support. 

To use a bastion host in GCP, users first connect to the bastion host, then connect to the target VM. Bastion hosts are designed to withstand attacks and limit entry points to a network. They can be configured to use Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP) to securely access the bastion host from a remote client. 

Here are some steps for creating a bastion host in GCP: 

1. Enable the [[Identity Aware Proxy]] API under Security > Identity-Aware Proxy 
    
2. Configure the OAuth consent screen, specifying whether to permit internal or external users 
    
3. Create a firewall rule to allow Google's IAP service access to port 22 
    
4. Generate cloud-init configs using the `generate-cloud-init.py` script or other tools 
    
5. Use the configs to create user accounts within the bastion host's virtual machine image, configure those accounts with SSH keys, and prepare HIBA configuration files
