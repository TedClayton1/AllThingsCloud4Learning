This page introduces the Memorystore for Memcached service, including use cases, key concepts, and the advantages of using Memcached.

Memorystore for Memcached is a highly scalable, fully managed Memcached service for the Google Cloud. The service is built on open source Memcached and is binary and ASCII protocol compliant. This service can be accessed using standard OSS Memcached client libraries across all languages, making it easy to lift and shift existing applications with little to no code changes.

High-performance, scalable web applications often use a distributed, in-memory data store to achieve low latency and high performance. Memcached is a popular distributed in-memory key-value store used for building such applications. Some of the common Memcached use cases include caching of reference data, database query caching, and, in some cases, use as a session store.

To learn more about Memcached, see the Open Source Software (OSS) MemcachedÂ [about page](https://memcached.org/about).

Memorystore also makes it very easy to deploy a Memcached service. You deploy Memorystore and Google manages the service for you, so that you can focus on your application. Memorystore gives you all the benefits of Memcached without the overhead of installing and managing it.
