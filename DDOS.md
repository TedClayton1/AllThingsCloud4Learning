A Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack is ==a cybercrime that involves flooding a server with internet traffic to prevent users from accessing online services and sites==. 

There are several types of DDoS attacks, including:

- **Volumetric attacks**
    
    These attacks overwhelm a target's network bandwidth by sending a large amount of data or traffic. Examples include UDP floods, ICMP floods, and reflection attacks. 
    
- **Application layer attacks**
    
    Also known as Layer 7 attacks, these attacks target web applications and services by sending many requests or initiating connections. 
    
- **Protocol attacks**
    
    Also known as state-exhaustion attacks, these attacks exploit weaknesses in layer 3 and layer 4 of the protocol stack to cause a service disruption. An example of a protocol attack is a SYN attack, which consumes all available server resources. 
    
- **Low and slow attacks**
    
    These attacks send traffic and HTTP requests at a very slow rate to evade detection. 
    
- **Slowloris attacks**
    
    These attacks overwhelm a web server by opening and maintaining many simultaneous HTTP connections to a target server. 
    

Some examples of DDoS attacks include:

- Mafiaboy Attack (2000)
- Estonia Attack (2007)
- GitHub (2018)
- Dyn (2016)
- ProtonMail (2015)
- Mirai Botnet (2016)
