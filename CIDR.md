Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) is ==a set of IP standards that helps organizations efficiently allocate IP addresses to devices that connect to the internet==. CIDR is important in cloud computing because it can help optimize IP address usage and reduce costs. 

CIDR allows a single IP address to represent a range of addresses, which can make the available address space more flexible and efficient. For example, in Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs), CIDR notation is used to define the size and range of an IP address block. This notation is usually written as a prefix and a number, such as `/24`. 

CIDR notation is a compact way to represent an IP address and its associated network mask. It was invented by Phil Karn in the 1980s.
