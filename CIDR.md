Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) is ==a set of IP standards that helps organizations efficiently allocate IP addresses to devices that connect to the internet==. CIDR is important in cloud computing because it can help optimize IP address usage and reduce costs. 

CIDR allows a single IP address to represent a range of addresses, which can make the available address space more flexible and efficient. For example, in Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs), CIDR notation is used to define the size and range of an IP address block. This notation is usually written as a prefix and a number, such as `/24`. 

CIDR notation is a compact way to represent an IP address and its associated network mask. It was invented by Phil Karn in the 1980s.

Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) is ==a method for allocating IP addresses to devices on a network==, which can improve the efficiency of data routing. CIDR works by combining multiple IP addresses into a single network prefix, which represents the common part of the addresses. This allows a single IP address to represent a range of addresses, which can be more flexible and efficient than the previous class-based system. 

Here are some benefits of CIDR: 

- Improved efficiency: CIDR can improve the efficiency of address distribution and pack routing. 
    
- Increased scalability: CIDR can help prevent the exhaustion of IPv4 addresses and has helped boost scalability and performance. 
    
- Reduced router table sizes: CIDR can help minimize router table sizes. 
    

However, CIDR does have some disadvantages, including:

- Increased complexity
    
    CIDR can make a network's address more complex, which can make processes more complex than traditional classful addressing.
    
- Compatibility issues
    
    CIDR isn't compatible with every network device, and older devices may struggle to work with classless routing.
