Cloud Dataprep is an intelligent data preparation web application on the Google Cloud Platform that has been offered by Trifacta, a privately owned software company with headquarters in San Francisco.

This tool is very useful for data analysts and data scientists to visually explore, clean, and transform a dataset using a simple workflow of drag and drop transformations in a user-friendly interface instead of writing complicated code.

It is a serverless and fully managed service that can drastically reduce and simplify the amount of work required to get the data ready for analysis, reporting, and machine learning.

In this blog post, IÂ´ll give an introduction to this tool. The target audience is people on the beginner and intermediate levels.
