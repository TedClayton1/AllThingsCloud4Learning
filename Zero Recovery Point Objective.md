Zero recovery point objective (RPO) means that ==an organization cannot tolerate any data loss, even for a second, without causing significant harm to the business==. 

RPO is a measurement of how much data an organization can lose before it causes detrimental harm. It's usually measured in units of time, such as minutes or hours. For example, a company with an RPO of 10 minutes can tolerate up to 10 minutes of data loss during an outage. 

Zero RPO is possible, but it's not easy to achieve. To achieve zero RPO, organizations need to: 

- Use continuous data replication techniques 
    
- Build distributed, multi-region systems that can heal themselves 
    
- Isolate applications from risks like machine failures and cloud outages 
    

Data that's critical to the business, like financial transactions or medical records, is often classified as zero RPO data.
