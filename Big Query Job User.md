A BigQuery Job User role in Google Cloud ==allows users to run jobs, such as queries, within a project==. This role is typically granted to data engineers and analysts in their respective data marts and data warehouses.

Here are some other things to know about BigQuery jobs:

- **Job actions**
    
    BigQuery jobs are actions that BigQuery performs on behalf of a user to load, export, query, or copy data.  
    
- **Job initiation**
    
    Users can initiate a job by using the Google Cloud console, a SQL statement, the bq command-line tool, or an API call.  
    
- **Job management**
    
    BigQuery administrators can monitor, manage, and troubleshoot jobs to ensure they are running smoothly.  
    
- **Job permissions**
    
    To run a BigQuery job, users need the bigquery.jobs.create IAM permission.  
    
- **Job status**
    
    Users can check the status of a job by calling jobs.get with the job ID and location. A job is considered done when its status.state is DONE, but this doesn't necessarily mean it completed successfully.  
    
- **Job failure**
    
    A job has failed if it has an errorResult property. The status.errorResult property contains information about what went wrong.
