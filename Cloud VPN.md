A cloud virtual private network (VPN) is ==a technology that allows users to securely access their organization's files, data, and applications through a website or application==. It's also known as VPN as a service (VPNaaS) or cloud based remote access VPN. 

A cloud VPN works by creating an encrypted connection between a user and their company's network infrastructure, which is hosted in the cloud. This connection is often facilitated by a VPN gateway that acts as an intermediary, encrypting and decrypting data sent to and from the cloud resources. 

Cloud VPNs are a good choice for organizations with remote workforces, multiple office sites, or recurrent access requirements to their network infrastructure. They can help employees who are traveling, working from home, or working on the go securely access networks, and remove the need for fixed desks in an office. 

Cloud VPNs are easy to set up and manage, and require little to no technical knowledge to maintain. They are also cost-effective and scale well, securely connecting multiple devices in locations across the globe.
