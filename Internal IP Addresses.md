An internal IP address is used ==to uniquely identify devices within a local network==, allowing them to communicate with each other without needing to access the wider internet, thus enhancing security by preventing unauthorized external access and efficiently routing data within the network. 

Key points about internal IP addresses:

- **Local communication:**
    
    Devices on the same network (like your computer, printer, and phone) use internal IP addresses to talk to each other directly, without going through the public internet. 
    
- **Privacy and security:**
    
    Since internal IP addresses are not publicly accessible, they protect your devices from unauthorized access from outside your network. 
    
- **Efficient routing:**
    
    Your router uses internal IP addresses to determine which device on your network should receive incoming data. 
    
- **Private IP range:**
    
    Internal IP addresses fall within specific reserved ranges (like 192.168.x.x) which are not routable on the public internet.
