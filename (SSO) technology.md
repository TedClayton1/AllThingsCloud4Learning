Single sign-on (SSO) is ==a cloud security technology that allows users to access multiple applications and websites with one set of login credentials==. SSO can be beneficial for both users and organizations, as it: 

- Improves user experience
    
    Users can access password-protected resources without having to repeatedly log in. 
    
- Improves security
    
    SSO helps organizations avoid shadow IT, which is when users use applications that are not sanctioned for official use. 
    
- Eases password management
    
    SSO eliminates the need to synchronize passwords to different systems. 
    
- Reduces IT management overheads
    
    SSO reduces the need to manage multiple identities for different applications. 
    

Here's how SSO works: 

1. When a user attempts to access an application, they are redirected to an external identity provider (IdP) to authenticate. 
    
2. The IdP validates the user's credentials, such as a username and password or one-time password (OTP). 
    
3. The IdP sends a token back to the service provider to confirm the successful authentication. 
    
4. The token is passed to the service provider through the user's browser. 
    
5. The service provider validates the token based on the trust relationship established during the initial configuration. 
    
6. The user is granted access to the service provider.
