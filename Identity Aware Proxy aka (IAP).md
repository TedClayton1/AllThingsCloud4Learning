Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP) is ==a Google Cloud service that uses identity and context to control access to applications and VMs==. It can protect access to applications hosted on Google Cloud, other clouds, and on-premises applications. IAP can also protect SSH and RDP access to VMs hosted on Google Cloud.

IAP can help with: 

- Enforcing access control policies
    
    IAP can help enforce access control policies for applications and resources. 
    
- Setting up group-based application access
    
    IAP can help set up group-based application access. 
    
- Securing access to apps
    
    IAP can secure access to apps in less time than it takes to implement a VPN. 
    
- Protecting critical systems and customer data
    
    IAP can help reduce the risk of breaches and data exposure with identity-based security automation. 
    

IAP uses a fine-grained approach to user authentication and authorization. It considers various factors such as user identity, device status, and location to make access decisions. For example, IAP can deny access if it detects a suspicious login attempt from an unfamiliar location. 

IAP can be used with signed headers or the App Engine standard environment Users API to secure an app. When IAP is turned on, signed headers must also be used to secure the app.
