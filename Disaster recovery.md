Disaster recovery (DR) is **an organization's ability to restore access and functionality to IT infrastructure after a disaster event, whether natural or caused by human action (or error)**.

A disaster recovery (DR) site in the cloud, or cloud disaster recovery (cloud DR), is ==a service or strategy that allows businesses to back up and restore their data and applications to the cloud==: 

- **Purpose**
    
    The goal of cloud DR is to protect a business's resources and ensure that it can continue operating after a disaster. 
    
- **How it works**
    
    Businesses can store backup data, apps, and other resources in the cloud, either through a public cloud or a dedicated service provider. If a disaster occurs, the business can restore the affected data, apps, and resources to the cloud or to their primary data center. 
    
- **Benefits**
    
    Cloud DR can help businesses:
    
    - Minimize downtime 
        
    - Ensure business continuity 
        
    - Build resilience against disasters 
        
    - Save on up-front costs 
        
    - Distribute mission-critical applications across multiple cloud regions 
        
    
- **Testing**
    
    Cloud DR solutions make it easy to test the effectiveness of backup systems by replicating productive environments and simulating real-life scenarios. This helps businesses identify vulnerabilities or bottlenecks in their systems before they become disasters.
