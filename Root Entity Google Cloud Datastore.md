In Google Cloud's Datastore, a root entity is ==an entity that doesn't have a parent==. Root entities and all of their descendants are part of the same entity group. The ancestor path of a root entity is empty, and its key is made up of only its identifier and kind.

A "root [[entity" in Google Cloud Datastore is ==essentially the top-level "parent" of a group of related data==, meaning it has no parent itself and acts as the starting point for a hierarchy of entities within a specific data set; like the main trunk of a tree, where all other entities branch off from it, allowing you to easily organize and query data that belongs together. 

Key points about root entities:

- **No parent:**
    
    Unlike other entities, a root entity doesn't have a parent entity, making it the "root" of its entity group.
    
- **Organizing data:**
    
    By creating a root entity, you can group related data together, which is especially useful when you need to perform transactions on multiple pieces of data that should be treated as a single unit.
    
- **Ancestor path:**
    
    When you create a new entity with a parent, the path of parent entities leading to the root entity is called its "ancestor path". 


- **Unique identifier:**
    
    Each root entity has a unique identifier, which can be either a custom string name or a numeric ID, that distinguishes it from other root entities of the same kind. 
    
- **Accessing data:**
    
    To access a specific root entity, you need to use its "kind" (like a category) and its unique identifier in your query.
    

Example:

Imagine you're storing data about a customer and their orders in Datastore:

- **Root entity:** "Customer" - This would be the main entity representing a customer.
- **Child entities:**
    - "Order" - Each individual order placed by a customer would be a child entity with the "Customer" entity as its parent.
    - "Shipping Address" - Details like a customer's shipping address could be another child entity linked to the "Customer" entity.


Imagine you're storing information about a company in Datastore.

- **Kind:** "Company"
- **Root Entity:** A company named "Google" with an identifier "google-corp" 

How to think about it like a "dummy":

- Think of a root entity as the main entrance to a building, and its identifier as the unique address of that entrance. 
- If you need to find a specific office within the building (a child entity), you would first need to know the building's main entrance (the root entity) and then navigate through the floors and rooms to reach your target.
