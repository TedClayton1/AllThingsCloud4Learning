In Google Cloud's Datastore, a root entity is ==an entity that doesn't have a parent==. Root entities and all of their descendants are part of the same entity group. The ancestor path of a root entity is empty, and its key is made up of only its identifier and kind.

A "root entity" in Google Cloud Datastore is ==essentially the top-level "parent" of a group of related data==, meaning it has no parent itself and acts as the starting point for a hierarchy of entities within a specific data set; like the main trunk of a tree, where all other entities branch off from it, allowing you to easily organize and query data that belongs together. 

Key points about root entities:

- **No parent:**
    
    Unlike other entities, a root entity doesn't have a parent entity, making it the "root" of its entity group.
    
- **Organizing data:**
    
    By creating a root entity, you can group related data together, which is especially useful when you need to perform transactions on multiple pieces of data that should be treated as a single unit.
    
- **Ancestor path:**
    
    When you create a new entity with a parent, the path of parent entities leading to the root entity is called its "ancestor path". 
    

Example:

Imagine you're storing data about a customer and their orders in Datastore:

- **Root entity:** "Customer" - This would be the main entity representing a customer.
- **Child entities:**
    - "Order" - Each individual order placed by a customer would be a child entity with the "Customer" entity as its parent.
    - "Shipping Address" - Details like a customer's shipping address could be another child entity linked to the "Customer" entity.
