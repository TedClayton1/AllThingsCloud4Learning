What is a REST API for dummies?

A REST API is **based on the HTTP protocol and uses HTTP requests to POST (create), PUT (update), GET (read), and DELETE data**. These APIs are often exposed over a simple URL like https://example.com/api/users and applications can interact with this API by making HTTP requests to this URL/endpoint. Jan 29, 2023

A REST API call is ==a request sent from a client application to a server, following the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style, to retrieve or manipulate data (a "resource") on the server by specifying a unique URL and using standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE==, essentially acting like a web browser requesting information from a website, where the response is typically structured data like JSON or XML. 

Key points about a REST API call:

- **Resource-based:**
    
    Each piece of data (like a user, product, or order) is considered a "resource" with its own unique URL on the server. 
    
- **HTTP Methods:**
    
    - **GET:** Used to retrieve data from a resource. 
        
    - **POST:** Used to create a new resource. 
        
    - **PUT:** Used to fully update an existing resource. 
        
    - **DELETE:** Used to delete a resource. 
        
    

How a REST API call works:

1. 1. **Client request:**
    
    The client application sends a request to the server using a specific URL that identifies the desired resource and includes the appropriate HTTP method. 
    
2. 2. **Server processing:**
    
    The server receives the request, authenticates the client if necessary, and retrieves the requested data from its database or storage. 
    
3. 3. **Response:**
    
    The server sends back a response to the client, which includes the requested data in a structured format like JSON or XML, along with a status code indicating whether the request was successful. 
    

Example:

- **Request:**
    
    To get information about a user with ID "123" from a user management API, a client might send a GET request to the URL "https://api.example.com/users/123". 
    
- **Response:**
    
    The server would return a JSON response containing details like the user's name, email, and other relevant information. 
    

Benefits of REST APIs:

- **Simplicity:** Easy to understand and implement due to the use of standard HTTP methods and URL structures. 
    
- **Scalability:** Can handle large volumes of requests due to its stateless nature. 
    
- **Flexibility:** Allows for different client applications to interact with the same API.
