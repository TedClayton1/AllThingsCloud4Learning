In cloud computing, service accounts are non-human accounts that allow applications and services to interact with each other and with other systems. They are used to enable communication and authentication between applications, databases, and other resources. 

Here are some things to know about service accounts in cloud computing: 

1. Authentication
Service accounts can authenticate as themselves or as Google Workspace or Cloud Identity users. 
  Permissions
Service accounts are granted IAM roles that allow them to access Google Cloud resources. 
Security
Service accounts are a key security feature for Google Cloud projects because they grant access to trusted connections and reject malicious ones. 
Attachment
Service accounts can be attached to resources, such as Compute Engine instances, to allow applications running on those resources to authenticate as the service account. 
Email address
Each service account has a unique email address. 
Service accounts are different from user accounts, which are associated with human users.
