Here are some things to consider about these storage classes:

- **Cost**: The cost of storage depends on the class and the region. 
    
- **Durability**: All storage classes are highly durable. 
    
- **Minimum storage duration**: Each storage class has a minimum storage duration. 
    
- **Retrieval fees**: Nearline and Coldline storage have retrieval fees. 
    
- **Autoclass**: This feature automatically moves data to the appropriate storage class based on access patterns. 
    
- **Object Lifecycle Management**: This feature allows you to create rules that change an object's class. However, it can take up to 24 hours for changes to go into effect
