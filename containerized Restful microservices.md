Containerized RESTful microservices ==use containers to deploy microservices, which are small, single-function modules that work together to create scalable applications==:

- Containers
    
    Software packages that contain all the resources and operating environment a microservice needs, allowing it to run independently from hardware and operating systems. Containers are semi-isolated environments that share resources with the server's operating system, making them more efficient than virtual machines (VMs). Containers also abstract away service differences, allowing services to interact without interfering with each other.
    
- Microservices
    
    Self-contained units that are packaged with their codebase, database, and dependencies. Each microservice can be developed and deployed independently of other services, and scaled out independently. This approach allows for faster application development, easier adoption of microservices architecture, and reduced overhead.
