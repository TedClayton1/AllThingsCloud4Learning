Here are some cloud migration strategies:

- Rehost
    
    Also known as "lift and shift", this strategy involves moving applications or data without changing code. It's a basic strategy that's considered low risk and complication.
    
- Refactor
    
    This strategy involves moving software to the cloud while also fixing the code to make it compatible with the cloud infrastructure.
    
- Replatform
    
    Also known as "lift, tinker, and shift" or "lift and reshape", this strategy involves moving an application to the cloud while also optimizing it for efficiency, cost reduction, or to take advantage of cloud capabilities.
    
- Retire
    
    This strategy involves turning off services that are no longer needed, including redundant workloads.
    
- Retain
    
    This strategy involves keeping some parts of an IT portfolio on-premise while also running cloud applications using a part-migration method. 
    

Other cloud migration strategies include repurchase.

Some benefits of cloud migration include:

- Lower costs
- Faster and more reliable performance
- Access to cloud-based developer tools and APIs
- More robust security
- Ability to increase or decrease capacity without needing to purchase, install, and maintain new equipment
