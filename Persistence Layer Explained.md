A Persistent layer's primary purpose is **to support the higher layers in the Data Warehouse**. You could query a Persistent layer directly, but, because of the temporal nature of the data, it becomes difficult to write the temporal joins.

 **maps these structured objects to the persistence implementation to perform the data retrieval or updates**. The persistence layer accepts structured data objects (SDOs) which are transformed (mediated) into objects called physical SDOs. Physical SDOs are stored in the data service layer.

What is persistence in cloud computing?

Persistent storage, also known as non-volatile storage, **retains data even after the device is powered down**. For monolithic applications running on traditional infrastructure, persistence is a given. The application runs on a single host and accesses local disk storage, which is logically and physically persistent.Dec 13, 2022
