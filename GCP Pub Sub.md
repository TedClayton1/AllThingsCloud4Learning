What is pub sub in cloud computing?

Google Cloud Pub/Sub is **a fully-managed, scalable, global and secure messaging service that allows you to send and receive messages among applications and services**. You can use Cloud Pub/Sub's to integrate decoupled systems and components hosted on Google Cloud Platform or elsewhere on the Internet.

Publish-subscribe (pub/sub) messaging is ==a communication model that allows applications to exchange messages asynchronously without knowing the sender or recipient's identity==. It's a popular method for real-time messaging and is often used in software architecture to facilitate communication between different systems or components.

Pub/sub **makes the software more flexible**. Publishers and subscribers are decoupled and work independently from each other, which allows you to develop and scale them independently. You can decide to handle orders one way this month and then another the following month.

Pub Sub is also great for processing/storing data 

- Cloud Storage subscriptions
    
    Pub/Sub can ingest streaming data into Cloud Storage data lakes. This can be done using the Google Cloud console, Google Cloud CLI, Google Cloud client library, or the Pub/Sub API. 
    
- Message storage policies
    
    Pub/Sub can store and process messages in specific Google Cloud regions. This can be done regardless of where the publish or subscribe requests originate. 
    
- Pub/Sub to Cloud Storage Text template
    
    This streaming pipeline can save records from a Pub/Sub topic as text files in Cloud Storage. The template can generate a new file every five minutes by default. 
    
- Message retention duration
    
    This option specifies how long Pub/Sub retains messages after publication. The default value is seven days, with a minimum value of 10 minutes and a maximum value of seven days. 
    

Pub/Sub can also be used to:

- Distribute change events from databases
- Distribute tasks among multiple workers
- Relay events among applications
- Move data between data stores
- Refresh distributed caches
- Update records in business systems
