What is pub sub in cloud computing?

Google Cloud Pub/Sub is **a fully-managed, scalable, global and secure messaging service that allows you to send and receive messages among applications and services**. You can use Cloud Pub/Sub's to integrate decoupled systems and components hosted on Google Cloud Platform or elsewhere on the Internet.

Publish-subscribe (pub/sub) messaging is ==a communication model that allows applications to exchange messages asynchronously without knowing the sender or recipient's identity==. It's a popular method for real-time messaging and is often used in software architecture to facilitate communication between different systems or components.

Pub/sub **makes the software more flexible**. Publishers and subscribers are decoupled and work independently from each other, which allows you to develop and scale them independently. You can decide to handle orders one way this month and then another the following month.
