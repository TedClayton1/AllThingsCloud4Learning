End-to-end encryption (E2EE) is ==a security method that combines encryption at rest and encryption in transit to keep messages private from everyone, including the messaging service==: 

- Encryption at rest: Data is stored in an encrypted form when it's generated at the source. 
    
- Encryption in transit: Data is encrypted as it travels between devices, preventing third parties from accessing it.
