Kubernetes is an open source solution for managing application containers. [[Google Kubernetes Explained in 100 seconds]] is also a great resource.

 ➤ With Kubernetes, you can decide when your containers should run, increase, or decrease the size of application containers or check the resource consumption of your application deployments. 
 
 ➤ HELM - Helm charts are packages that contain all the information /configuration files-(volumes, [[mount point]] networking, load balancer) that Kubernetes needs to know for managing a specific application within the cluster.

GKE - is a cluster manager and orchestration system for running Docker containers in the cloud.

➤ GKE a production-ready environment with guaranteed uptime, load balancing and included container networking features. It allows you to create multiple-node clusters while also providing access to all Kubernetes’ features. 

With the help of Google Kubernetes Engine, you can create the environment, which is a production ready environment in just a few minutes. This will provide the Google Security, all the benefits of the Google Cloud networking, all benefits of Google Cloud svc, the other services like Big Data, big table ,anything which you want to connect with your application. You can connect that particular application in the Google Kubernetes engine as well. Also, it allows all the features which are available in the Kubernetes as Kubernetes is the developed solution by Google. So Google Kubernetes Engines have alot of benefits and extra things compared to the open source Kubernetes. GKE is a recommended cluster. If you are executing your application in the Kubernetes in the coming lecture, I will show you how you can create the Google Kubernetes engine and how you can configure the Google Kubernetes and with the help of the command line and the UI.
