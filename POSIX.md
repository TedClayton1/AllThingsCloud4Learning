The **Portable Operating System Interface** (**POSIX**; [IPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet "International Phonetic Alphabet"): [/ˈpɒz.ɪks/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English "Help:IPA/English")[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX#cite_note-FAQ-1)) is a family of [standards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization "Standardization") specified by the [IEEE Computer Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_Computer_Society "IEEE Computer Society") for maintaining compatibility between [operating systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system "Operating system").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX#cite_note-FAQ-1) POSIX defines both the system and user-level [application programming interfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API "API") (APIs), along with command line [shells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell "Unix shell") and utility interfaces, for software compatibility (portability) with variants of [Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix "Unix") and other operating systems.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX#cite_note-FAQ-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX#cite_note-IET-2) POSIX is also a [trademark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark "Trademark") of the IEEE.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX#cite_note-FAQ-1) POSIX is intended to be used by both application and system developers.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX#cite_note-3).

Released in the late 1980s, [POSIX (Portable Operating System Interface)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX) is a family of standards created to make sure that applications developed on one UNIX flavor can run on other UNIXes. The POSIX standard describes how system calls must behave. One particular section of the standard defines the semantics (behavior) of a POSIX compatible file system. Today, many of the UNIX systems that existed back in the 80s and 90s have become irrelevant. On the other hand, Linux became [[ubiquitous]]; one of the reasons being the POSIX compatibility. Being POSIX compatible made it easier to move from a UNIX to LINUX.
