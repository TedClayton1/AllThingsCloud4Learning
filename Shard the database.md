Database sharding is ==a technique that splits a single database into smaller, more manageable partitions called shards==. Each shard contains unique rows of data that are stored separately on different computers, or nodes, but share the original database's design. 

Sharding is a type of horizontal partitioning that can improve performance, scalability, and availability. It can help distribute the workload of storing and retrieving data across multiple servers, which can make databases faster and easier to manage, especially when datasets are too large to fit in a single database. Sharding can also make it easier to balance traffic load across different shards
