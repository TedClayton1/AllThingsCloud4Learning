"Persist raw logs on GCP" means ==to store unprocessed, original log data (referred to as "raw logs") within Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for later analysis==, essentially saving the unfiltered log information in a persistent storage location like a Cloud Storage bucket, allowing you to access and examine the raw data even after it might have been parsed or processed for other purposes. 

Key points about persisting raw logs on GCP:

- **Unprocessed data:**
    
    Raw logs are the original log entries generated by a system, without any formatting or structuring applied. 
    
- **Storage location:**
    
    This data is typically stored in a Google Cloud Storage bucket, allowing for long-term retention and access. 
    
- **Analysis and investigation:**
    
    By keeping raw logs, you can investigate issues by directly examining the unparsed log data, especially when standard log analysis tools might not capture all necessary details. 
    

Use cases for persisting raw logs:

- **Advanced troubleshooting:**
    
    When investigating complex issues, you might need to analyze the raw log details to understand the exact sequence of events. 
    
- **Security analysis:**
    
    Examining raw logs can be crucial for identifying potential security threats that might not be apparent in processed logs. 
    
- **Custom log parsing:**
    
    If you need to develop custom log parsing rules to extract specific information from your logs, having the raw data is essential
