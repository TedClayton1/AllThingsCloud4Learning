- **Dedicated memcache** provides a fixed cache capacity assigned exclusively to your application. It's billed by the GB-hour of cache size and requires billing to be enabled. Having control over cache size means your app can perform more predictably and with fewer reads from more costly durable storage.



	In cloud computing, the "key" of a hash refers to ==the input data that is used by a hash function to generate a unique, fixed-length hash value==; essentially, it's the original piece of information that is being transformed into a shorter, encrypted string for storage and identification purposes. 

Key points about hash keys in cloud computing:

- **Function:**
    
    The hash function takes the "key" (input data) and produces a unique "hash" (output value). 
    
- **Security:**
    
    Hashing is often used for data security because it's a one-way process, meaning it's very difficult to reverse the hash back to the original key. 
    
- **Applications:**
    
    In cloud computing, hashes are used for tasks like data integrity checks, password storage, object identification in storage systems, and more.
