Google Cloud Platform (GCP) offers multiple cron services that allow users to schedule tasks to run at specific times or intervals: 

- App Engine Cron Service
    
    Automatically triggers cron jobs that make HTTP GET requests to a specified endpoint in the same app. Schedules can be defined using start-time and end-time intervals. 
    
- Cloud Scheduler
    
    Allows users to set up cron jobs, also known as scheduled units of work, that are sent to a target according to a specified schedule. Targets can be HTTP/S endpoints, Pub/Sub topics, or App Engine HTTP/S applications. Schedules can be defined using a format based on unix-cron, and can run multiple times a day or on specific days and months. Cloud Scheduler also offers features like secure invocation, fault-tolerant execution, and unified management. 
    
- CronJobs in Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
    
    Create Kubernetes jobs on a repeating schedule to automate tasks like backups, reports, emails, and cleanup. CronJobs can be created, managed, scaled, and deleted in the same way as Jobs.
