Load Balancer function is to distributes user traffic across multiple instances of application. 

➤ Load Balancing reduces the risk that applications become overburdened, slow, or nonfunctional. 

➤ Cloud Load Balancer serve content as close as possible to users on a system. 

➤ Cloud Load Balancing is a fully distributed, software-defined managed service. 

➤ Load Balancers are couple with Instance Group to Support HA Environment and Auto Scaling

External load balancers distribute traffic coming from the internet to your Google Cloud Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network. 

➤ Internal load balancers distribute traffic to instances inside of Google Cloud. 

➤ Global load balancing - backends are distributed across multiple regions. 

➤ Regional load balancing - backends are in one region.

What do Load Balancers do? Load balancers improve application performance by increasing response time and reducing network latency. They perform several critical tasks such as the following: Distribute the load evenly between servers to improve application performance. **Redirect client requests to a geographically closer server to reduce latency**.

Cloud load balancing is ==a software-based service that distributes traffic, workloads, and client requests across multiple servers in a cloud environment==. It's designed to manage large workloads so that no single server becomes overwhelmed by requests, which can lead to downtime and increased latency.
