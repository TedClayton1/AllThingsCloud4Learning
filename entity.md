In cloud computing, an entity is ==a data object that can have one or more named properties, each with one or more values==. Entities are similar to rows in a relational database, and each entity is represented by a key. Entities of the same type don't need to have the same properties, and the values for a given property don't need to be the same data type. However, an application can enforce these restrictions in its data model if needed. 

Entities are categorized by a particular kind for the purpose of queries. For example, in a human resources application, each employee could be represented by an entity of the kind "Employee".


In a cloud computing database, an "entity" refers to ==a distinct object or concept that represents a single piece of data, like a person, place, or thing, about which information can be stored and managed within the database==; essentially, it's a single row of data with specific attributes that can be uniquely identified within the system. 

Key points about entities:

- **Real-world representation:**
    
    Entities are designed to mirror real-world objects or concepts, allowing for easier data modeling and understanding. 
    
- **Attributes:**
    
    Each entity has attributes which are the specific pieces of information associated with it, like a customer's name, address, or phone number. 
    
- **Relationships:**
    
    Entities can be linked together through relationships, showing how different data points are connected within the database. 
    
- **Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs):**
    
    Database designers often use ERDs to visually represent entities and their relationships within a database schema. 
    

Example:

- **In a customer database:**
    - **Entity:** "Customer"
    - **Attributes:** Name, Email, Phone Number, Address
