Google Cloud's Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is ==a virtual version of a physical network that provides networking capabilities for cloud-based resources and services==. VPCs are hosted within Google's production network and can be customized to meet specific needs. They offer many of the benefits of public cloud computing, such as flexibility, agility, and reliability, while also providing the data isolation of a private cloud. 

VPCs can be used to: 

- Connect to Compute Engine virtual machine (VM) instances
    
    VPCs provide networking for VM instances, Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) clusters, and serverless workloads. 
    
- Connect to on-premises networks
    
    VPCs can use Cloud VPN tunnels and VLAN attachments for Cloud Interconnect to connect to on-premises networks. 
    
- Distribute traffic
    
    VPCs can distribute traffic from Google Cloud external load balancers to backends. 
    
- Provide private access to Google services
    
    VPCs provide private access to Google services, such as cloud storage, AI and machine learning products, and smart data analytics. 
    

Some other features of VPCs include: 

- Subnets
    
    Logical divisions within a VPC that are identified by a range of IP addresses. Subnets can help organize resources and apply network-level security controls. 
    
- VPC flow logs
    
    Capture information about IP traffic going to and from network interfaces on Compute Engine. VPC flow logs can be used for network monitoring, forensics, real-time security analysis, and expense optimization.
