Key points about [[key object]]

- **Unique identifier:**
    
    A key object is a combination of attributes that uniquely identifies an entity within a data store, allowing for precise retrieval of specific data. 
    
- **Primary key equivalent:**
    
    In relational databases, a key object is often analogous to the primary key, which is a set of columns that uniquely identifies each row in a table. 
    
- **Data access mechanism:**
    
    When querying a database, the key object is used to specify which specific entity you want to retrieve. 
    

How they relate:

- **Access through root entity:** When interacting with an aggregate, you would always access its related entities through the root entity, using its key object to identify the specific aggregate you want to interact with.
