An endpoint is **a remote computing device that communicates back and forth with a network to which it is connected**. Examples of endpoints include: Desktops. Laptops.

In cloud computing, an endpoint can refer to ==a physical device that connects to a network, or it can refer to a distributed API management system==: 

|Type of endpoint|Description|
|---|---|
|Physical device|A device that connects to a network, such as a desktop computer, mobile device, or server.|
|Virtual endpoint|A network-accessible resource that is not a physical device, such as a cloud service or web-based application.|
|API management system|A distributed system that provides management, monitoring, and authentication for APIs.|

Endpoints are assigned a network-specific IP address to identify them on the network. 

Some components of endpoint security include: Identity and access management (IAM), Threat intelligence, and Compliance and governance. 

Endpoint security solutions may include: Endpoint Protection Platforms (EPP), Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR), and Extended Detection and Response (XDR). 

The terms "endpoint" and "edge" are often used interchangeably, but they have different meanings. Endpoint computing is localized computing, while edge computing is distributed computing.
