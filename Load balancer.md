A load balancer is ==a device or service that distributes user traffic across multiple servers or applications to improve the performance and reliability of an application==: 

- **How it works**
    
    A load balancer acts as an intermediary between the user and the servers, routing requests to the most appropriate server. Load balancers can be software or hardware devices. 
    
- **Benefits**
    
    Load balancers help prevent server overloads, improve user experience, and increase availability: 
    
    - **Server health**: Load balancers continuously check the health of servers and remove unhealthy ones from service. 
        
    - **Capacity utilization**: Load balancers ensure that servers are used equally and not overworked. 
        
    - **Reliability**: Load balancers can help eliminate single points of failure. 
        
    
- **Load balancing algorithms**
    
    Load balancers use algorithms to determine which server to send a request to. There are two main types of algorithms: static and dynamic. 
    
- **Load balancing methods**
    
    One simple load balancing method is round robin, where requests are sent to each server in turn.
