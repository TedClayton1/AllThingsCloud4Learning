In database cloud computing, an "aggregate" refers to ==a single value calculated by combining multiple data points from a set of records using an aggregate function==, such as SUM, AVG, COUNT, MIN, or MAX, essentially summarizing a group of data into a single, meaningful result; it's a core concept in data analysis and is commonly used to gain insights from large datasets by grouping and calculating statistics on them. 

Key points about aggregates:

- **Function in SQL:**
    
    In Structured Query Language (SQL), aggregate functions are used within queries to perform calculations on data sets, allowing you to retrieve summarized information like the total sales amount, average price, or number of customers within a specific category. 
    
- **Data grouping:**
    
    To calculate an aggregate, you typically need to group data based on certain criteria using a "GROUP BY" clause in a SQL query. 
    
- **Example:**
    
    If you have a table of product sales with columns like "product_id", "price", and "quantity", you could use an aggregate function like "SUM(price * quantity)" to calculate the total sales revenue for each product.
