A stateless web API, or RESTful API, is ==a type of API that treats each client request to the server as a separate transaction, without maintaining any knowledge of previous requests==:

Why use a stateless Web API?

Stateless APIs can be useful for applications that require rapid and independent request processing because ==they can improve efficiency and reduce server load==. Here are some other advantages of stateless APIs:

- Development
    
    Stateless APIs can be simpler to develop, test, and maintain because they don't require managing state across multiple requests.
    
- Scaling
    
    Stateless APIs can scale to millions of concurrent users by deploying them to multiple servers. Each request is processed separately, which improves load balancing and horizontal scaling.
    
- Fault tolerance
    
    If one server instance fails, another instance can handle the next request without losing context.
    
- Caching
    
    Stateless APIs are easy to cache
