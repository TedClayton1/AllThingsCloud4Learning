A batch processing job is ==a software program that is automatically run in batches by a computer==. Batch jobs are often used to process high-volume, repetitive data tasks that are inefficient to run individually.

Batch jobs are characterized by:

- **Automation**
    
    Batch jobs are often automated and run without human intervention, except for some tasks that require manual input. 
    
- **Scheduling**
    
    Batch jobs can be scheduled to run at specific times, or when computing resources are available. 
    
- **Offline**
    
    Batch jobs can run in the background or offline, even outside of regular business hours. 
    
- **Monitoring**
    
    Batch jobs monitor for errors and system failures, and handle them appropriately. 
    

Some examples of batch jobs include: Backups, Filtering, Sorting, and Reading a large file and generating a report. 

The term "batch job" originated in the 19th century when Herman Hollerith created the first tabulating machine. Hollerith's machine used punched cards to represent data, which could be processed in batches.
