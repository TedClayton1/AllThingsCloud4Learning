Docker isÂ **a software platform that allows you to build, test, and deploy applications quickly**. Docker packages software into standardized units called containers that have everything the software needs to run including libraries, system tools, code, and runtime.

There are multiple container formats available on the market. GKE supports the most popular one, which is Docker. Docker is an open platform and allows you to develop and run containerized applications. It can run on multiple Linux images offered in GCP as they have the same kernel. Docker images are created using a definition called a **Dockerfile**. This [[docker explanation in 100 seconds]] is also a great resource.
