A relational database (RDBMS) is ==a collection of data organized into tables, or "relations," of rows and columns that have predefined relationships==. This structure makes it easy to see how different data structures relate to each other. 

Some types of relational database models include: 

- One-to-many: One entity is related to multiple other entities 
    
- One-to-one: Two specific objects have a direct and unique relationship 
    
- Many-to-many: A many-to-many model
