**SQL databases are vertically scalable, while NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable**. SQL databases are table-based, while NoSQL databases are document, key-value, graph, or wide-column stores. SQL databases are better for multi-row transactions, while NoSQL is better for unstructured data like documents or JSON.
