**SQL databases are vertically scalable (increasing the power of a single server or cluster rather than add multiple servers/clusters to add instances of the database and scale up), while NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable**(adding more servers to the system). SQL databases are table-based, while NoSQL databases are document, key-value, graph, or wide-column stores. SQL databases are better for multi-row transactions, while NoSQL is better for unstructured data like documents or JSON.
