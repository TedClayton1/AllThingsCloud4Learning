Cloud Functions **removes the work of managing servers, configuring software, updating frameworks, and patching operating systems**. The software and infrastructure are fully managed by Google so that you just add code. Furthermore, provisioning of resources happens automatically in response to events.


Yes, ==Cloud Run functions can scale to zero instances when they don't receive any traffic==. This is because Cloud Run automatically scales the number of instances needed to handle incoming requests, events, or CPU utilization. 

Here are some things to consider about Cloud Functions scaling: 

- Cold starts
    
    When a function is scaled down to zero, it can take a few seconds to initialize and start serving requests. This is known as a cold start. 
    
- Minimum instances
    
    To reduce cold starts, you can set a minimum number of instances that Cloud Run functions must keep ready to serve requests. This is especially recommended for latency-sensitive applications. 
    
- Maximum instances
    
    You can also set a maximum number of Cloud Run functions instances to control cost and prevent downstream resources from being overwhelmed. 
    
- Instance limits
    
    The default maximum instances limit for 2nd gen HTTP functions is 100, but it can be increased to 1,000. There is no default maximum instances limit for 1st gen HTTP functions.
