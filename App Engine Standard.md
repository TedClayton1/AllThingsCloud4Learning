What is App Engine standard in GCP?

The App Engine standard environment isÂ **based on container instances running on Google's infrastructure**. Containers are preconfigured with one of several available runtimes. The standard environment makes it easy to build and deploy an application that runs reliably even under heavy load and with large amounts of data.

App Engine is a serverless compute service that scales your applications from zero to planet-scale without having to manage infrastructure.

This option fits both requirements - no-ops and auto-scaling.
