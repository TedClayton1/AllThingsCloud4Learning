Data persistence is the longevity of data after the application that created it has been closed. In order for this to happen, the data must be written to non-volatile storage — a type of memory that can retain that information long-term, even if the application is no longer running.

When data is persisted, it means that the exact same data can be retrieved by an application when it’s opened again. The data remains the same, and nothing is lost in between sessions.
