Google Cloud Run is ==a serverless compute platform that allows users to run code on Google's infrastructure==. It's built from Knative and abstracts away infrastructure management so developers can focus on building applications
Also, it's a managed microservices platform that allows you to just build your app into a container, then let Google worry about handling all the infrastructure management from there.
