HA VPN stands for High Availability Virtual Private Network. It is a type of virtual private network (VPN) setup that provides redundancy and ensures continuous connectivity between on-premises networks and cloud resources. HA VPN is typically used in cloud environments, like Google Cloud Platform (GCP), to create a secure and reliable connection between an organization's data center or on-premises network and resources hosted in the cloud.

Here are some key aspects of HA VPN:

1. Redundancy: HA VPN is designed to be highly available and fault-tolerant. It achieves this by setting up redundant connections between the on-premises network and the cloud environment. If one connection fails, traffic automatically fails over to the backup connection, ensuring continuous connectivity.
    
2. Load Balancing: HA VPN can leverage load balancing to distribute traffic across multiple VPN tunnels, optimizing performance and preventing overload on a single tunnel.
    
3. VPN Tunnels: In HA VPN, multiple IPsec VPN tunnels are established between the on-premises VPN gateway and the cloud VPN gateway. Each tunnel is associated with a unique public IP address
