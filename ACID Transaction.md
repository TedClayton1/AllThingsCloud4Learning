What is ACID in GCP?

ACID stands forÂ **Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability**. These four ACID properties define database transactions. When they are all met, they guarantee database transaction validity, even in the event of system crashes, power failures, and other errors.

Yes, several Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services support ACID transactions, including BigQuery, Firestore, and Spanner: 
 
BigQuery: Supports ACID transactions and snapshot isolation. BigQuery's storage is automatically replicated across multiple locations for high availability. 
 
Firestore: Supports ACID transactions across shards with serializable isolation. 
 
Spanner: Supports global ACID transactions. 
 
CockroachDB: A PostgreSQL-compatible distributed SQL database that supports global ACID transactions. 
 
ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability, which are the four key properties that define a transaction. A database operation that has these properties is called an ACID transaction. 
 
BigTable only supports ACID properties at the raw level. Cloud Bigtable is not a relational database and does not support ACID transactions or SQL queries.
