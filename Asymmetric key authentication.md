Asymmetric key authentication, also known as asymmetric cryptography or public key cryptography, is ==a cybersecurity tool that uses two mathematically linked keys to verify a person's identity==:

- Public key: Can be given to anyone, trusted or not
- Private key: Must be kept secret 

Asymmetric key authentication can be used for a variety of purposes, including:

- Message verification
    
    When someone sends a message or signs a document using their private key, the corresponding public key can be used to verify their identity. For example, if Bob uses Alice's public key to decrypt a message, he can be sure that Alice sent the message because she never shared her private key with anyone.
    
- Authenticating objects
    
    Can ensure that an object is genuine and authorized to connect to a product, and prevent counterfeiting and cloning 
    

However, asymmetric key authentication also has some disadvantages, including:

- Complexity: Asymmetric encryption is complex and therefore slow.
- Resource-intensive: It requires more computation and storage space than symmetric encryption, making it unsuitable for encrypting large amounts of data.
- Vulnerability to attacks: Asymmetric key authentication can be vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks, where an attacker makes independent connections with victims and relays, modifies, injects, or deletes messages between them.
