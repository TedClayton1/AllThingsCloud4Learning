Instance preemption is ==when a cloud provider can terminate a virtual machine (VM) instance to reclaim its compute capacity for other uses==. Preemptible instances are similar to regular compute instances, but they are designed for short-term use and can be terminated at any time. They are often offered at a lower price than standard VMs, sometimes by as much as 91%. However, their availability can vary depending on usage, and they are not suitable for long-running workloads
