Structured data is organized information that follows a predefined format and is stored in fixed fields within a file or record. Unstructured data, on the other hand, lacks a specific structure and is stored in its native format. 


Here are some examples of structured data:

- Dates and times
- Cell phone numbers
- Social security numbers
- Banking and transaction information
- Customer names, postal addresses, and email addresses
- Product prices
- Serial numbers
- Excel files
- SQL databases
- Point-of-sale data 

Here are some examples of unstructured data:

Text files, PDF documents, Social media posts, Comments, Images, Audio/video files, Emails, Sensor data, Surveillance imagery, and Log files. 

Structured data is easier to search and organize, and can be stored in databases. Unstructured data can make up between 80 and 90 percent of all data generated globally, but it's less valuable than structured data because it's harder to handle and extract insights from.
