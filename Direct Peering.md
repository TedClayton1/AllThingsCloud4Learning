When established, Direct Peering **provides a direct path from your on-premises network to Google services**, including Google Cloud products that can be exposed through one or more public IP addresses.



Direct peering is ==a voluntary connection between two networks that allows users to exchange traffic directly==. It can be used to: 

- **Connect to Google services**
    
    Businesses can use direct peering to connect their network to Google's edge network and access Google services like Google Cloud, Google Maps, and YouTube. 
    
- **Improve security**
    
    Direct peering is more secure than remote peering because the networks are physically connected, which reduces the risk of unauthorized access. 
    
- **Reduce latency**
    
    Direct peering can reduce latency and hops to services, which can improve connectivity. 
    
- **Keep traffic local**
    
    Peering can keep traffic local, which can improve performance and provide faster connections. 
    
- **Connect to other networks**
    
    Direct peering can be used to connect a company's service provider to another content delivery network (CDN) or internet service provider (ISP). 
    
- **Reduce costs**
    
    Peering can save money by allowing a network to push traffic to another network for free. 
    

Direct peering works by connecting a customer's managed router to a public Autonomous System Number (ASN). Enterprises can request a public ASN from the ARIN for US-based companies or the RIPE for EU-based
