NoOps (no operations) is ==a concept that aims to automate IT environments so that they require little to no human involvement==. It's associated with cloud computing, serverless computing, and PaaS, and is mostly applicable to cloud infrastructure. NoOps environments automate traditional operations like code deployment, patching schedules, and infrastructure management.


At a high level, NoOps means that there is no infrastructure to build out and manage during usage of the platform. Typically, the compromise you make with  
NoOps is that you lose control of the underlying infrastructure.
