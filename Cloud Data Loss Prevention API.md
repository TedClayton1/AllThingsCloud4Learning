Google Cloud Platform's Data Loss Prevention (DLP) API ==helps organizations manage sensitive data by detecting, redacting, masking, and tokenizing it==. The API can also analyze risk and de-identify sensitive fragments in text, images, and Google Cloud Platform storage repositories. 

Cloud DLP works by scanning an organization's cloud infrastructure for sensitive data, such as personal information, financial records, or intellectual property. It can help organizations comply with regulations like GDPR and reduce the risk of data exposure and breaches. 

Data exposure can happen when sensitive information becomes accessible to unauthorized individuals. This can be due to a number of reasons, including: 

- Inadequate application protection 
    
- Misconfigurations 
    
- Inappropriate data system usage 
    
- Permissive access controls 
    
- Moving data out of a controlled environment, either intentionally or unintentionally
