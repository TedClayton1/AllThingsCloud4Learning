Content Provider codes (CP codes) identify your traffic on the ​Akamai​ network for reporting, billing, and monitoring purposes. When you purchase an ​Akamai​ product, you create a CP code as you onboard associated properties. You may also generate additional CP codes, typically to implement more detailed billing and reporting functions, and to assign to customized properties. For more information refer to the [CP codes](https://techdocs.akamai.com/cp-codes/docs) documentation.
